## What is this?

Google reader is shutting down.  A lot of people use it.  A lot of apps depend on its API.  
This project will be an attempt to create an API compatible replacement so those apps will 
continue to work by simply changing the API end point.  I have no plans to build a frontend UI 
replacement, just the backend API.

## Tech

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
* [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org) (so I can try something new!)
* [Express](http://expressjs.org/)
* [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/)

Some interesting modules to investigate:

* https://github.com/danmactough/node-feedparser
* https://github.com/dylang/node-rss

Some unofficial API documentation on the old Google Reader API that we'd be copying

* http://undoc.in

Feel free to fork this repository and send pull requests implementing features.  Once you've
sent a couple good ones, I'll add you as a contributor to the project to commit directly.

We should probably have an IRC room on Freenode.  I'll set that up later.
