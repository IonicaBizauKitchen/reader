## What is this?

Google reader is shutting down.  A lot of people use it.  A lot of apps depend on its API.  
This project will be an attempt to create an API compatible replacement so those apps will 
continue to work by simply changing the API end point.  I have no plans to build a frontend UI 
replacement, just the backend API.

## Tech

I plan to build this using Node.js and a database backend.  I was considering using Mongo just 
because I'd like to try something new, but I'm happy to use standard MySQL as well.

Some interesting modules I found:

* https://github.com/danmactough/node-feedparser
* https://github.com/dylang/node-rss

Some unofficial API documentation on the old Google Reader API that we'd be copying
